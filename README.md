# Welcome!
My name is Brie Haynes and I am currently a third year CS student at UT Dallas with an interest in pursuing in full-stack development. In my free time, I like to play guitar, read, and take photos with my instant cameras!

## What I’m Working On
Right now, I am working on an API called The Polaroid API. Since I have a lot for Polaroid cameras and want to know how to build an API, I figured this could be a fun——and useful——project!
