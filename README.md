# Welcome!
My name is Brie Haynes and I am currently a senior Software Engineering student at UT Dallas. I am interested in pursuing a career in full-stack web development, but systems programming and database management are also of interest to me. In my free time, I like to play guitar, read, and indulge in some very addicting video games.

# What I Do
In my most recent career experience, I was a software engineering intern at PagerDuty, where I helped maintain the front-end and the back-end of their Automation Actions product! As of right now, I am back in school.

## What I’m Working On
Right now, I am working on a web application called *FretNote*. FretNote will help guitar players become more knowledgeable of the guitar’s fretboard through interactive quizzes! It is being built with React.js (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the front-end and the Phoenix framework (Elixir) for the back-end.
