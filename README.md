# Welcome!
My name is Brie Haynes and I am currently a third year CS student at UT Dallas interested in pursuing in full-stack development. I have also dabbled in networking and database management. In my free time, I like to play guitar, read, and take photos with my instant cameras!

# What I Do
Recently I was a software engineering intern at PagerDuty, where I helped maintain the front-end and the back-end of their Automation Actions prodct! As of right now, I am back in school.

## What I’m Working On
Right now, I am working on an API called The Polaroid API. Since I love and have a lot of knowledge about Polaroid cameras coupled with an interest in API development, I figured this could be a fun project! I plan on building the front-end with the basics (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and the back-end with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
