# Welcome!
My name is Brie Haynes and I am currently a third year CS student at UT Dallas with an interest in pursuing in full-stack development. In my free time, I like to play guitar, read, and take photos with my instant cameras!

# What I Do
Besides being a student, I am also very active in my school’s NSBE chapter. I help facilitate a space for other black engineers on campus, and currently am preparing to start managing the UTD NSBE Developer Team!

## What I’m Working On
Right now, I am working on an API called The Polaroid API. Since I love and have a lot of knowledge about Polaroid cameras coupled with an interest in API development, I figured this could be a fun project! I plan on building the front-end with the basics (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and the back-end with Node.js and Express.
